Clusterware is either not running or not configured. You have the following 2 options:
 1. Configure and start the Clusterware on this node and re-run the tool
 2. Run the tool with '-oh <GI_HOME>' to first patch the Grid Home, then invoke tool with '-database <oracle database name>' o           r '-oh <RAC_HOME>' to patch the RAC home

OPATCHAUTO-72029: CLusterware home not configured.
OPATCHAUTO-72029: Clusterware is either not running or not configured or cluster is software only GI
OPATCHAUTO-72029: If only Grid Infrastructure software is installed, please run opatchauto with '-oh' option . Alternatively c           onfigure and start the Clusterware before running opatchauto.
