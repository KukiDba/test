DB File Sequential Read. 
=========================
This event generally indicates a single block read (an index read). 

For example -- 
A large number of waits here could indicate poor joining orders of tables, or unselective indexing. It is normal for this number to be 
large for a high-transaction, well-tuned system, but it can indicate problems in some circumstances. You should correlate this wait 
statistic with other known issues within the Utlstat/Statspack report, such as inefficient SQL. Check to ensure that index scans are 
necessary, and check join orders for multiple table joins. Problematic hash-area joins should show up in the PGA memory, but they're also 
memory hogs that could cause high wait numbers for sequential reads. They can also show up as direct path read/write waits. 


DB File Scattered Read.
=======================
This generally indicates waits related to full table scans. As full table scans are pulled into memory, they rarely fall into 
contiguous buffers but instead are scattered throughout the buffer cache. A large number here indicates that your table may have 
missing or suppressed indexes. Although it may be more efficient in your situation to perform a full table scan than an index scan, 
check to ensure that full table scans are necessary when you see these waits. Try to cache small tables to avoid reading them in over 
and over again, since a full table scan is put at the cold end of the LRU (Least Recently Used) list.
